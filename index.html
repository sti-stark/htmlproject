            <h2><a href="/martin.html" target="_blank">Martin Scorsese</a></h2>
            <p>
                Martin Scorsese is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. One of the major
                figures of the New
                Hollywood era, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential directors in film
                history. Scorsese's body of work explores themes such as Italian-American identity, Catholic concepts of
                guilt and redemption,faith, machismo, crime and tribalism. Many of his films are known for their
                depiction of violence, and the liberal use of profanity and rock music. In 1990, he founded The Film
                Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 2007 he founded the World Cinema
                Foundation and in 2017, he introduced the African Film Heritage Project.
            <p>
                Scorsese studied at New York
                University, where he received a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1964, and received a master's
                degree in fine arts in film from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in 1966. In 1967 Scorsese's first
                feature film Who's That Knocking at My Door was released and was accepted into the Chicago Film
                Festival, where critic Roger Ebert saw it and called it "a marvelous evocation of American city life,
                announcing the arrival of an important new director"

            <h2><a href="turing.html" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a></h2>
            <p>
                Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and
                theoretical
                biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
                providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which
                can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the
                father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.Despite these accomplishments,
                he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of
                homophobia at the time and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
            <p>
                During the
                Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park,
                Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section
                that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for
                speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
                electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.

            <h2><a href="richard.html" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a></h2>
            <p>
                Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral
                formulation of quantum
                mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid
                helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For
                contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics
                in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga. Feynman developed a widely used
                pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions
                describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his
                lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading
                physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked as one of the ten greatest
                physicists of all time.

            <p>
                He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public
                in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle
                Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with
                pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.
